        <p> <h1>Being Vegetarian is not enough</h1>
        
       Those Who are already vegetarian think that they are saving animals and it's obvious because they don't consume any meat product but still we are still as cruel as meat eaters or may be more. The reason behind this the milk and dairy products we consume. (Well I don't now) We consume honey thinking that it's not cruel to have honey but again we don't even bother to look at the procedure and we even don't care about that but that's so cruel too. 
        Lets go into the deep and get to know how it's cruel.

        <br> 
        <p>
        Dairy is cruel because Cows in the dairy industry suffer their entire lives. From the moment they enter this world they are treated like commodities. Special bonds are routinely broken and cows often develop painful medical conditions.
<br>
        Just like humans, cows only produce milk for their offspring. Therefore, they are forcefully impregnated every year. A female and her offspring are forced through a cycle of cruelty that ends with their slaughter.

        Much like humans, cows have strong maternal instincts but a mother’s bond with her calf has no place on factory dairy farms. Shortly after birth, calves are dragged away from their mother never to be seen again. A cow will have to go through this painful process every year of her life. The milk she produces for her calf is instead taken from her and sold to consumers.
        After being torn away from their mothers, calves will spend much of their lives in extreme confinement. In fact, most will spend the first 2 to 3 months of life confined in lonely barren hutches, fed a diet of milk replacer while humans drink the milk intended for them. This just a small part of the whole cruelty. Please research more and get to know the harsh truth behind the industries who have hidden the darkest of secrets and help animals they really need our compasion they don't deserve to live in pain because they have never done anything wrong with us. Please don't ignore there pain your little attention can give them cruelty free life.

        Saving innocent animals is not a hard thing to do. We just need to exclude those products that support animal cruelty.

Going vegan means that you stop eating, wearing, or using anything that came from an animal, such as meat, milk, eggs, and leather. Just by going vegan, you’ll save the lives of nearly 200 animals a year. Pretty awesome, right?
