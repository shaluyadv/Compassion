    <p> <h1>Help and Save Animals</h1>
    Hello Friends! Welcome to My Webpage</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today I would like to talk about animals but a little bit first about myself. I am a person who believes in God and Loves him so much. I am a nature Lover. I want everyone to be happy specially Animals. Animals are very innocent They are so loveful. Sometimes I wish that I could finish all the pain that Animals Feel. I was already a vegetarian but I didn't know that being vegetarian is not enough because the milk, ghee, curd everything that is made from Milk is cruel and bloody so I have become Vegan.
    
    This is one of the best decisions of my life. I am also creating awareness on social media platforms about animal cruelt by posting status and sharing posts about innocent Animals. </p>

    <p><h1>How Animals Are Suffering Because Of Our Choices</h1>The abuse animals suffer at human palms is heartbreaking, sickening, and infuriating. It’s even greater so when we realize that the normal picks we make—inclusive of what we consume for lunch and the type of shampoo we buy—may be at once supporting a number of this abuse. But as difficult as it is to think about, we are able to’t prevent animals’ suffering if we appearance the opposite manner and pretend it isn’t occurring.

        Animals assume compassionate humans like you to present them a voice and be their heroes by way of studying about their issues and taking movement. Each people has the power to store animals from nightmarish suffering-and pleasant of all, it’s easier than you would possibly assume. If you’re geared up to sign up for the hundreds of thousands of other compassionate those who are operating to create a kinder, better international for animals, find out how animals go through whilst used for experimentation, meals, amusement, garb, and the pet alternate. Together, we are able to make a difference. <a href="https://www.peta.org/"> For more info</a> </p>

        <p>To help animals first we need to understand their suffering. There is no other way to understand their pain until we start thinking us being at their place. We need to understand that they feel pain too when they get injured just like we do. They feel the same way as we do. They may not speak the way we do but that doesn't mean they can't talk and feel pain or love. Just because we have more power doesn't give us the right to misuse or exploit others. If we have power we must use it to other's well being not to harm those who are helpless.
